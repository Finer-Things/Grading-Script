def letter_grade_assigner(row):
    """
    This letter grade assigner takes a raw grade percentage and outputs a letter grade. There are two peculiarities to this function that are not in a standard letter grade assigner: 
    1) This course has a tradition of grading with a "Great Effort Rule" that assigns a B to students who earn a C or better through raw score if they took most of the quizzes, came to lecture and completed at least most of the homework. I took a quick look at the spreadsheet and did not find any students who fell into this category without having reasonably high homework and quiz scores, so I just applied this to everyone. 
    2) This was a tough quarter, and some students struggled all quarter with low grades and ended up doing a stellar job on the final. I believe that these students earned the grade they got on the final (especially because this was not a take-home exam, which would offer them the chance to get "helped" by someone else). So the students who received a higher percentage on the final than they did in the class were graded according to their final score. The great effort rule was not applied in this case, nor should it be. 
    Functionality: The variable num is used as a default for a letter grade assignment. You will see this not used in the case of being assigned B grades because the Great Effort Rule is based on their raw score. For the lines below, num could have been used instead of row["Final"] without change, but I think this could have easily muddied what was happening so I kept the "Final" argument.
